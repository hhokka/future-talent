### Implemented

- Customer requires that application is implemented using React Native

- Observation should display name of species, rarity, excerpt of notes, and date and time

- Main view should include a button for adding new observation

- Clicking the button should navigate user to observation form view

- In observation form view user should be able to add a new observation

- User should be able to input name of the species and notes

- User should be able to save the observation

- Timestamp should be created when observation is saved

- All observations should be saved locally on the device

  

### Not implemented

- Main view should include a dynamic list of observations.
  - The list itself is dynamic, but only static data are used.
- User should be able to select rarity from predefined list (common, rare, extremely rare)
  - No predefined list, only a free text field.
- User should be able to cancel the new entry. Any data entered by the user will be discarded
  and the observation will not be saved.
  - This is not implemented yet.
- Saved observations should be persisted when application is closed
  - May work, not tested
- No bonus features
